# Neo4jPoc

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pedromsmoreira/neo4j-poc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pedromsmoreira/neo4j-poc)

Proof of Concept using Neo4j Graph Database.

In this PoC I created an API to return actors and movies from a default Graph Database.

The objective was to learn and explore the Cypher query language and the possibilities of applying a Graph Database to real world projects.
